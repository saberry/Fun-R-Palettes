Package Description
-------------------

This package is for picking fun palettes to use in R.  It is nothing more than an assortment of goofy things that I enjoy. There are only two real functions (**showFunPals** & **funPalPicker**), but you can hopefully get some enjoyment out of seeing some of the palettes.  The **funPalPicker** function is an gadget that will open in your RStudio Viewer pane.

Installation
------------

```{r}
devtools::install_github('saberry/Fun-R-Palettes')
```

South Park
----------

These are palettes derived from the main characters in South Park and from the closing credits.

Turbo Kid
---------

Turbo Kid is an awesome movie.  If you have not seen it, I recommend you do so.  Some people say that you can sync it up with Lazerhawk's "Redline" album, but I am never sure when to take the cassette off pause.

Marvel
------

Because a 5-year-old demands it to be so.

Beavis and Butthead
-------------------

You probably won't get hurt, expelled, arrested, or deported for using this palette, but you might end up watching a few episodes.

Friday the 13th
---------------

### Coming Soon ###

These palettes will be derived from a collection of Friday the 13th movie posters.
